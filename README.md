# Project Title

This project is a Spring Boot application designed to demonstrate the use of Spring Batch and Spring Data JPA. It is configured with a Java 17 toolchain and uses MySQL as the primary database with H2 for testing purposes.

## Project Overview
This project showcases batch processing with Spring Batch and integrates with Spring Data JPA for data persistence. It supports database switching between MySQL (for development) and H2 (for testing). Lombok is used for code simplicity, reducing boilerplate code such as getters, setters, and constructors.

## Tech Stack
- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot 3.3.4**
- **Spring Batch 5.1.2**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **MySQL 8.4** (runtime database)
- **H2** (testing database)
- **Lombok** (for reducing boilerplate code)
- **JUnit5** (for testing)
